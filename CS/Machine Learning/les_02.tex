\chapter{Convex Functions}

Some useful tricks for showing a function is convex:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1-variable, twice-differentiable function is convex iff $f''(w)\ge 0$ for all $w$.
    \item A convex function multiplied by non-negative constant is convex.
    \item Norms and squared norms are convex.
    \item The sum of convex functions is a convex function.
    \item The max of convex functions is a convex function.
    \item Composition of a convex function and a linear function is convex.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
    Not true that composition of convex with convex is convex:
\end{remark}
